I’m Mustafa, and my journey in data analysis began with a fundamental curiosity: Why is some data complex to uncover, and how can simplifying this complexity change the narratives that reshape our everyday experiences?\nWhat if the image below wasn’t just a view of Earth at night, but a reflection of the complexity of data? Each light could be a piece of information, scattered and interconnected, waiting to tell a story. How much could we uncover just by taking a closer look? Data can feel overwhelming, like staring at all these lights for the first time, but once we start making sense of it, patterns and insights begin to emerge. What do you see in this image? What story would you start to tell?"
